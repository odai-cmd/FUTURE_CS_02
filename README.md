# 🔐 Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response  

This repository documents my cybersecurity internship projects, where I practiced SOC (Security Operations Center) workflows using SIEM tools like splunk.  
The focus is on monitoring simulated security alerts, analyzing suspicious activities, classifying incidents, and drafting incident response reports.  


 📝 Overview  
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of security monitoring and incident response using industry-standard SIEM platforms.  
It simulates real-world SOC activities by:  
- 🟠 Ingesting and analyzing logs from multiple sources  
- 🔎 Detecting anomalies and suspicious activities with custom rules  
- 🚨 Classifying incidents based on severity and potential impact  
- 🛡 Drafting structured incident response reports with mitigation recommendations  

The goal is to strengthen practical cybersecurity skills in threat hunting, log analysis, and SOC operations, preparing for real-world security analyst responsibilities.  


🛠 Skills Gained: 
- 📊 Log ingestion & analysis  
- ⚙️ SIEM rule creation (custom threshold)  
- 🚨 Alert triage & classification  
- 🏢 SOC operations basics  

🧰 Tools & Environment  

- 🟦 Splunk Cloud (Free Trial) – SIEM tool for log analysis  
- 📂 Sample DNS Logs – Simulated DNS query data  
- 🌐 Edge Browser – For accessing Splunk dashboards  
- 📸 Snipping Tool – To capture screenshots  
- 📝 MS Word – Used to compile reports
